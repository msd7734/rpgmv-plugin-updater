#	[root]

; A folder containing a JSON (.js) file generated by RPG Maker MV that saves a project's plugin data.
; The file generated is always called plugins.js
; default = js
; default can be replaced with any other valid path to a file
Location=default

[pluginsfolder]
; The folder where plugins are located.
; default = js/plugins
; default can be replaced by an other valid directory.
Location=default

[root]
; The root url of a page containing direct links to .js plugin resources.
; If a plugin's update link points to a root page, the resource will be searched for among the links
; on that page.
YanflyRoot=http://yanfly.moe/plugins/en


[batch]
; This section defines wildcard patterns to represent all plugins that match that pattern.
; For example, YEP* matches plugins with names YEP_CoreEngine, YEP_EquipCore, YEP_BaseTroopEvents, etc.
YanflyPlugins=YEP*

[plugin]
; Plugins will be updated from the url value on the right.
; If the given plugin name matches a value defined in batch, the update value will apply to all
; plugins that match the batch string. Otherwise it will be treated as a single plugin.
; Values here can be direct urls (http://example.com/MyPlugin.js) or root pages from [root].
YanflyPlugins=YanflyRoot

[update]
; How to handle updates if they are found. Possible values are:
; 	auto (default) - Overwrite all outdated plugins with new versions.
;	save - Save new plugin versions to an updates folder in the current directory.
;	none - Just check for and notify of updates, but don't do anything with them.
